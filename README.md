# Weather application

I have built an application which serves as a contact list of a specific person who has about 100 contacts in that list.
The list is filled with data thanks to the API called RANDOM USER GENERATOR.
As a result of the data, there are approximately 100 rows of extracted data.

## Description

This weather app is perfect for those who want to check the weather conditions in their area or any other location. The app uses data from OpenWeatherMap API to provide accurate and up-to-date information. It is easy to use and perfect for those who want to stay informed about the weather conditions.
